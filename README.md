Purely for fun, I write code purely as a hobby, similar in nature to playing CS and building LEGO. I want to try sending the code to attract the attention of experts, give me guidance, and even help me develop this project. I personally do not have any educational background in science, engineering, or computer science. I come from a background in humanities, painting, and art, without a strong foundation in mathematics or the practical application scenarios that programmers often encounter, so there must be a lot of problems with the code
