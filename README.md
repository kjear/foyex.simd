Purely for fun, I write code purely as a hobby, similar in nature to playing CS and building LEGO. I want to try sending the code to attract the attention of experts, give me guidance, and even help me develop this project. I personally do not have any educational background in science, engineering, or computer science. I come from a background in humanities, painting, and art, without a strong foundation in mathematics or the practical application scenarios that programmers often encounter, so there must be a lot of problems with the code

The mandatory requirement is MSVC C++20 for the Windows platform, as it extensively utilizes the unique APIs of the Windows platform and the syntax features of C++20

TODO:
  1. Improve the functions related to floating-point operations
  2. Add support for complex numbers
  3. Add support for AVX512
  4. Remove the dependency on the unique API of the MSVC compiler for the Windows platform <= I think this is quite important
  5. Optimize the performance of existing functions implemented by composite instructions
